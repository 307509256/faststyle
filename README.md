This repository is a Tensorflow implementation of JC Johnson's fast style transfer [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155), combined with D. Ulyanov's instance normalization
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08022).

I am coding this up to acquire more fluency with Tensorflow, and to eventually use it as a leaping point for some applications I have in mind. If you've come
across this, note that there are other Tensorflow implementations of fast style on Github that are fully developed!
